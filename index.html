<p>This is a histogram of the homework grades of the Farmer Penguin, created using Google Sheets. I entered the grades in a 
column on the sheet, highlighted them, and created a histogram with the create chart option. 
  This is the histogram created with "auto" bucketing: <img src="farmerPenguinAuto.PNG" width="500" height="300">
  I then adjusted the bucket size - the
size of the groupings on the x-axis. I first chose 1, resulting in this graph: <img src="farmerPenguin1.PNG" width="500" height="300">
This histogram does not accurately portray the patterns of the homework grades. It is hard to tell that
  If the bucket size is 10, the histogram looks like this: <img src="farmerPenguin10.PNG" width="500" height="300">
  This histogram misrepresents the data because it lacks specificity - it is hard for a viewer to extract truth about the penguin's
  grades from this visualization. 
  A bucket size of 5 portrays the data well. It best shows in general the penguin's most common grades. It is 
clear from the histogram that the penguin commonly gets between a 34 and 39 on homework assignments.
