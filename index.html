<p>This is a histogram of the homework grades of the Farmer Penguin, created using Google Sheets. I entered the grades in a 
column on the sheet, highlighted them, and created a histogram with the create chart option. 
  This is the histogram created with "auto" bucketing:

 <p> I then adjusted the bucket size - the
size of the groupings on the x-axis. I first chose 1, seen in the second graph. 
   This histogram does not accurately portray the patterns of the homework grades. It is hard to tell that most of the student's grades
   are concentrated between 34 and 39, rather, the focus is on the high bar of 35.</p>

  <p>If the bucket size is 10, the histogram looks like this:

  This histogram misrepresents the data because it lacks specificity - it is hard for a viewer to extract truth about the penguin's
    grades from this visualization. </p>
  <p>A bucket size of 5 portrays the data well. It best shows in general the penguin's most common grades. It is 
clear from the histogram that the penguin commonly gets between a 34 and 39 on homework assignments.
